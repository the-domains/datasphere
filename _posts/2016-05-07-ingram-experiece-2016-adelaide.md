So this is a bit of free text, On Thursday I attended Ingram Experience 2016 in Adelaide.

It's a Trade show that's organised by the Distributor in the title. This post is really to try and highlight how an article or extended piece will look like on the Grid.

I arrived on time and Attended several presentations on Office 365 deployment for Small Business... I learnt a lot of Micrsoft specific info but the true value was in engaging with the vendors and getting some information directly from the distributor and gaining a deeper understanding of the services that they provide.

The real win was during a keynote presentation by Ian Elliot at the end entitled Marketing without Money. He's written a book Entitled Stop Bitching and Start Pitching... Once I've whipped The Grid into some kind of showcaseable state I'll write a more in depth review.
