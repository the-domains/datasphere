      Amazon Web Services (AWS) today announced that its Aurora database engine,
      which first launched in November in preview, is now generally available to
      customers. Aurora can power the existing Relational Database Service
      (RDS), and is compatible with MySQL and MariaDB databases. Aurora
      increases the performance of the RDS.

  Sysadmins in Sydney had a horrible Sunday, while their CEOs bent their
  attention to wondering why their Foxtel Rugby sportscasts weren't working. The
  Amazon Web Services AWS "power event" AP-SOUTHEAST-2 Region was almost
  certainly caused by a massive storm system that ran from Brisbane to the NSW
  South Coast, leading to a weekend of widespread flooding, blocked road and
  coastal erosion.
