Many small and medium business owners have complex IT needs but lack a budget for dedicated IT staff.

Datasphere IT aims to provide a number of services to it's clients that fulfill this niche requirement.

Where some Service providers seek to lock in their customers, Datasphere IT actively works to provide you with the independence of stable and efficient systems; a low touch profile that aspires to keep administration and problems to a minimum.

One way that we achieve this is by identifying and migrating high risk IT components into Cloud based services when relevant.

We supply equipment as a registered reseller from a number of distributors and vendors and we provide professional services to implement the solutions that you have chosen to enable your business. 

Upon request we can perform risk analysis, we can also audit and document your IT environment which is an invaluable exercise for IT environments that have had many hands pass over it. We can help you to create a disaster recovery plan that would enable you to rebuild your Infrastructure in the event of a catastrophic failure.

We also provide services that help to organize and manage your business's IT budget, by subscribing to a monthly service you can gradually build up an IT fund that helps smooth over any large purchasing requirements and maintain smoother cashflow.

With expertise within the Server, Storage, Linux, Windows and Virtual worlds you can rely on Datasphere IT Consultancy to be willing and able to help when needed the most.
